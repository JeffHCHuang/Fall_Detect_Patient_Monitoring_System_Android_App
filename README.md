# FallingMyo Patient Monitoring System Android Application
This is an Android application installed on a patient's mobile phones which will process accelerometer data from a Myo gesture control armband in real-time and send an alert to the web interface (https://github.com/JeffHCHuang/FallingMyo_Patient_Monitoring_System_Admin_Web_Interface) used by hospital personnel. It also provides an easy-to-use interface for patients to instantly request assitance from hospital personnel. This is the patient-facing side of the FallingMyo Patient Monitoring System, a project I have created along with teammates, Aftab Narsimhan and Renee Slamka, at nwHacks 2015 hosted at the University of British Columbia.
